The SCL pin is connected to the D22 pin (default I2C clock line) of the ESP32, and the SDA pin is connected to the D21 pin. The ESP32 has flexible I2C pin assignments, allowing any I2C pin to be configured as SDA or SCL. However, GPIO21 (SDA) and GPIO22 (SCL) are commonly used as default I2C pins for compatibility with existing code, and libraries.

### PH-4502C
